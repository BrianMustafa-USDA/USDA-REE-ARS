  - An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. When using CeleryExecutor, if an attacker     can connect to the broker (Redis, RabbitMQ) directly, it is possible to inject commands, resulting in the     celery worker running arbitrary commands. (CVE-2020-11981)

  - An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. When using CeleryExecutor, if an attack     can connect to the broker (Redis, RabbitMQ) directly, it was possible to insert a malicious payload     directly to the broker which could lead to a deserialization attack (and thus remote code execution) on     the Worker. (CVE-2020-11982)

  - An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. A remote code/command injection     vulnerability was discovered in one of the example DAGs shipped with Airflow which would allow any     authenticated user to run arbitrary commands as the user running airflow worker/scheduler (depending on     the executor in use). If you already have examples disabled by setting load_examples=False in the config     then you are not vulnerable. (CVE-2020-11978)

  - The previous default setting for Airflow's Experimental API was to allow all API requests without     authentication, but this poses security risks to users who miss this fact. From Airflow 1.10.11 the     default has been changed to deny all requests by default and is documented at     https://airflow.apache.org/docs/1.10.11/security.html#api-authentication. Note this change fixes it for     new installs but existing users need to change their config to default     [api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all as mentioned in the Updating Guide:

It is, therefore, affected by a remote code execution vulnerability in the JDNI parser due to improper log validation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands. 

Log4j 1.x, which reached its End of Life prior to 2016, comes with JMSAppender which will perform a JNDI lookup if enabled in Log4j's configuration file, hence customers should evaluate triggers in 1.x based on the risk that it is EOL and whether JNDI lookups are enabled.

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","Upgrade to Apache Log4j version 2.3.1 / 2.12.3 / 2.15.0 or later, or apply the vendor mitigation.

Upgrading to the latest versions for Apache Log4j is highly recommended as intermediate versions / patches have known high severity vulnerabilities and the vendor is updating their advisories often as new research and knowledge about the impact of Log4j is discovered.

    - A reverse proxy bypass vulnerability exists in vCenter Server due to the way the endpoints handle the URI.       An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to restricted endpoints.
      (CVE-2021-22006) 

    - An rhttproxy bypass vulnerability exists in vCenter Server due to improper implementation of URI       normalization. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to gain access to internal       endpoints. (CVE-2021-22017)
